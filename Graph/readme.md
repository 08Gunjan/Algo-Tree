# Graph

A graph is a pair (V, E), where V is a set of nodes, called vertices, and £ is a collection of pairs of vertices, called **edges**.

• Vertices and edges are positions and store elements

## Terms related to Graph

### Directed edge:
* ordered pair of vertices (u, v)

* first vertex u is the origin

* second vertex v is the destination

* Example: one-way road traffic

### Undirected edge:
* unordered pair of vertices (u, v)

* Example: railway lines

## Directed graph:
* all the edges are directed

* Example: route network

## Undirected graph:
* all the edges are undirected

* Example: flight network
